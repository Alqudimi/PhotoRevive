## The Alqudimi Processing Pipeline

Alqudimi Technology employs a sophisticated multi-stage pipeline that orchestrates all four AI models:

### Stage 1: Text-Based Pre-Processing (Optional)
If natural language instructions are provided, InstructIR processes the image first to address specific user requirements.

### Stage 2: Damage Detection and Inpainting
The system automatically detects and repairs physical damage:
- Scratch detection using edge detection algorithms
- Bright spot removal through threshold-based masking
- Inpainting using Telea algorithm for seamless repair

### Stage 3: Intelligent Colorization
DDColor analyzes the image and applies colorization if needed:
- Automatic grayscale detection
- Photo-realistic color generation
- Luminance preservation
- Natural color transitions

### Stage 4: Face Enhancement
CodeFormer identifies and enhances facial features:
- Face detection and localization
- Feature restoration and enhancement
- Fidelity-quality balance
- Background improvement

### Stage 5: Super-Resolution
SwinIR performs the final quality enhancement:
- 2x-4x upscaling
- Detail recovery
- Texture enhancement
- Noise reduction
